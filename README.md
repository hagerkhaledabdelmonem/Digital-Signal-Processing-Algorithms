# Digital-Signal-Processing-Algorithms

## Do Some Algorithms on one dimensional signal processing like:
- Discrete Fourier Transform
- Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform
- Convolution
- Correlation
- DC_Component
- Quantization and Encoding
- Discrete cosine transform 
- Filtering using window method (windows used :Rectangular, Hanning, Hamming, Blackman)
- FIR/IIR Filters
- Sampling (Up and down)
