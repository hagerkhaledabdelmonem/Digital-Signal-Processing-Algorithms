# Digital-Signal-Processing-Algorithms

## Do Some Algorithms on one dimensional signal processing like:

- Arithmetic Operators like:
  - Adding 2 Signals
  - Substring 2 Signals
  - Multipling Signal by Constant

- Accumulation of Input Signal
- Sharpening Signal by First & Second Derivatives
- Smoothing Signal by Moving Average
- Delaying or advancing a signal by k steps
-	Folding a signal 
- Normalizing Signal at any Range as You Want
- Discrete Fourier Transform
- Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform
- Direct & Fast Convolution
- Direct & Fast Correlation
- Time Delay Between 2 Signal by Correlation
- Compress Data by DC_Component
- Quantization and Encoding
- Discrete cosine transform 
- FIR Filter using window method (windows used :Rectangular, Hanning, Hamming, Blackman)
- Sampling (Up and down)
